# JavaScript Masters

> "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." — Atwood's Law

## The Pantheon

### Founding Father

- **[Brendan Eich](eich/)** — Creator of JavaScript
  - *Focus*: Language fundamentals, prototype-based OOP, first-class functions

### The Good Parts School

- **[Douglas Crockford](crockford/)** — Author of "JavaScript: The Good Parts"
  - *Focus*: Language subsetting, JSON, code quality, avoiding the bad parts

### Deep Understanding

- **[Kyle Simpson](simpson/)** — Author of "You Don't Know JS"
  - *Focus*: Scope, closures, `this`, prototypes, async patterns, true understanding

### Modern Application Architecture

- **[Dan Abramov](abramov/)** — Co-creator of Redux, React core team
  - *Focus*: State management, functional patterns, composition, developer experience

- **[Addy Osmani](osmani/)** — Author of "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns"
  - *Focus*: Design patterns, performance optimization, progressive web apps

### Testing & Developer Experience

- **[Kent C. Dodds](dodds/)** — Testing advocate, educator
  - *Focus*: Testing best practices, React patterns, developer productivity

## Shared Principles

Despite different emphases, these masters agree on:

1. **Understand the Language**: Know JavaScript deeply, not just frameworks
2. **Embrace Functions**: First-class functions are JavaScript's superpower
3. **Manage Async Well**: Callbacks → Promises → async/await, understand all
4. **Prefer Composition**: Small, focused functions composed together
5. **Test Thoughtfully**: Tests should give confidence, not just coverage

## JavaScript's Evolution

```
ES3 (1999)  → Foundation
ES5 (2009)  → strict mode, JSON, Array methods
ES6 (2015)  → Classes, modules, arrows, promises, destructuring
ES2017+    → async/await, optional chaining, nullish coalescing
```

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Crockford** for a solid foundation and avoiding pitfalls
2. **Add Simpson** for deep understanding of core mechanics
3. **Layer Abramov** for state management and React patterns
4. **Apply Osmani** for design patterns and performance
5. **Use Dodds** for testing and modern React practices
6. **Consult Eich** for language philosophy and advanced concepts
