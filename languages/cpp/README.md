# C++ Masters

> "C++ is a language that has been designed to be as efficient as possible, to be as close to the hardware as possible, and to support abstraction without sacrificing efficiency." — Bjarne Stroustrup

## The Pantheon

### Founding Father

- **[Bjarne Stroustrup](stroustrup/)** — Creator of C++, author of "The C++ Programming Language"
  - *Focus*: Language design, type safety, zero-overhead abstraction, RAII

### The Effective School

- **[Scott Meyers](meyers/)** — Author of the "Effective C++" series
  - *Focus*: Practical guidelines, avoiding pitfalls, understanding defaults

- **[Herb Sutter](sutter/)** — ISO C++ Committee Chair, author of "Exceptional C++"
  - *Focus*: Exception safety, const correctness, modern idioms

### Generic Programming Masters

- **[Alexander Stepanov](stepanov/)** — Creator of the STL
  - *Focus*: Algorithms, iterators, concepts, mathematical foundations

- **[Andrei Alexandrescu](alexandrescu/)** — Author of "Modern C++ Design"
  - *Focus*: Template metaprogramming, policy-based design, type manipulation

### Modern Voices

- **[Sean Parent](parent/)** — Former Adobe Principal Scientist
  - *Focus*: "No raw loops", algorithm-based thinking, code as mathematics

## Shared Principles

Despite different emphases, these masters agree on:

1. **Resource Management**: RAII is non-negotiable
2. **Type Safety**: Use the type system to prevent errors
3. **Zero-Overhead Abstraction**: Don't pay for what you don't use
4. **Const Correctness**: Immutability as default
5. **Standard Library**: Know and use it

## Evolution Timeline

| Era | Key Development | Key Figures |
|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| 1979-1998 | C with Classes → C++98 | Stroustrup |
| 1998-2011 | STL, Templates, Best Practices | Stepanov, Meyers, Sutter, Alexandrescu |
| 2011-2020 | Modern C++ (11/14/17/20) | All + Parent, Carruth, Gregory |
| 2020+ | Concepts, Ranges, Modules | Continued evolution |

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Stroustrup** for foundational principles
2. **Add Meyers** for practical daily guidance
3. **Layer Sutter** for robustness and exception safety
4. **Apply Stepanov** when designing generic components
5. **Use Alexandrescu** for library/framework design
6. **Finish with Parent** to refactor toward algorithm clarity
