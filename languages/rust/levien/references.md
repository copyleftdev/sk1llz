## Key Concepts by Source

### Xilem Architecture (2022 blog post)

- View trees as typed, ephemeral descriptions
- Widget trees as retained, stateful implementations
- Adapt nodes for component composition
- Id-path event routing with mutable state access
- Memoization for incremental updates

### Unified Theory of Reactive UI (2019 blog post)

- UI as a pipeline of tree transformations
- Trees as data structures vs. traces of execution
- Push vs. pull interfaces
- Incremental transformations and diffing

### Principled Reactive UI (2020 blog post)

- Observable objects vs. future-like polling
- Tree mutation patterns
- Stable identity in view trees
- The Crochet experiment (negative result)

### Advice for Rust GUIs (2022 blog post)

- Tradeoff space analysis (native feel, platform integration, GPU rendering)
- Winit as windowing layer
- Accessibility requirements (AccessKit)
- Architecture must evolve—no One True Solution yet

### On GPU Rendering

- [I want a good parallel computer](https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2025/03/21/good-parallel-computer.html) — GPU compute philosophy
- [Parallel curves of cubic Béziers](https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2022/09/09/parallel-beziers.html) — Path geometry

### On Curves and Typography

- Levien's PhD thesis on spline curve fitting
- Euler spiral (cornu spiral) applications to stroke expansion
- Font rendering: stem darkening, hinting, variable fonts

### Influences

- **SwiftUI**: Typed view trees, declarative syntax
- **Flutter**: Widget tree, render object tree separation
- **React**: Virtual DOM diffing, component model
- **Elm**: Unidirectional data flow (but not message passing)
- **FRP**: Functional reactive programming foundations

## Ecosystem Alternatives

Levien acknowledges these as viable alternatives while Xilem matures:

| Toolkit    | Architecture    | Notes                                      |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **egui**   | Immediate mode  | Simple, pragmatic, popular                 |
| **Iced**   | Elm-inspired    | Clean, well-designed                       |
| **Slint**  | Declarative DSL | Commercial, polished                       |
| **Dioxus** | React-like      | Interior mutability, credible alternative  |
