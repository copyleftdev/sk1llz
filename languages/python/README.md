# Python Masters

> "Readability counts." — The Zen of Python

## The Pantheon

### Founding Father

- **[Guido van Rossum](vanrossum/)** — Creator of Python, BDFL
  - *Focus*: Readability, simplicity, "one obvious way", the Pythonic ideal

### The Effective School

- **[Raymond Hettinger](hettinger/)** — Core developer, legendary educator
  - *Focus*: Beautiful idiomatic Python, iterators, generators, practical elegance

- **[Luciano Ramalho](ramalho/)** — Author of "Fluent Python"
  - *Focus*: Data model mastery, Pythonic idioms, special methods

### API & Library Design

- **[Kenneth Reitz](reitz/)** — Creator of `requests`
  - *Focus*: "For Humans" API design, beautiful interfaces, simplicity

- **[Armin Ronacher](ronacher/)** — Creator of Flask, Jinja2, Click
  - *Focus*: Pragmatic minimalism, composable design, explicit over implicit

### Deep Internals

- **[David Beazley](beazley/)** — Author of Python Cookbook
  - *Focus*: Generators, coroutines, concurrency, metaprogramming

## Shared Principles

Despite different emphases, these masters agree on:

1. **Readability**: Code is read far more than it's written
2. **Simplicity**: Simple is better than complex
3. **Explicitness**: Explicit is better than implicit
4. **Practicality**: Practicality beats purity
5. **Batteries Included**: Know the standard library

## The Zen of Python (PEP 20)

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with van Rossum** for foundational Pythonic thinking
2. **Add Hettinger** for idiomatic patterns and elegance
3. **Layer Ramalho** for deep data model understanding
4. **Apply Reitz** when designing APIs and interfaces
5. **Use Ronacher** for framework/library architecture
6. **Consult Beazley** for advanced patterns and internals
