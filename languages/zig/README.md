# Zig Masters

> "Zig is a general-purpose programming language and build system designed to be a better C."

## The Pantheon

### Creator

- **[Andrew Kelley](kelley/)** — Creator of Zig, President of Zig Software Foundation
  - *Focus*: Simplicity over complexity, compile-time metaprogramming, replacing C

### Community & Advocacy

- **[Loris Cro](cro/)** — VP Community at Zig Software Foundation
  - *Focus*: Teaching Zig, build system, practical applications

## Shared Principles

The Zig community agrees on:

1. **Simplicity**: No hidden control flow, no hidden allocations
2. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Make all behavior visible
3. **No Undefined Behavior**: Safety by default, opt-in unsafety
4. **Compile-Time Power**: comptime replaces macros and generics
5. **Interop with C**: Drop-in replacement, not reinvention

## The Zig Philosophy

```
Communicate intent precisely, not implementation details.
No hidden control flow or memory allocations.
Debug in any environment, including production.
Favor read-time convenience over write-time convenience.
Better than C: more expressive, safer, faster to write.
```

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Kelley** for core philosophy and language design
2. **Add Cro** for practical patterns and build system mastery
