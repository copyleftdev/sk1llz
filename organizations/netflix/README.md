# Netflix Engineering

> "The best way to avoid failure is to fail constantly."

## Engineering Philosophy

Netflix pioneered chaos engineering—the discipline of proactively injecting failures to build confidence in system resilience. Their engineering culture emphasizes freedom and responsibility, with a focus on availability at massive scale.

## Techniques

### Resilience & Reliability

- **[Chaos Engineering](chaos-engineering/)** — Chaos Monkey, Simian Army, controlled failure injection
  - *Book*: "Chaos Engineering: System Resiliency in Practice" (O'Reilly)
  - *Impact*: Defined the discipline, adopted industry-wide

## Key Figures

- **Casey Rosenthal** — Led Chaos Engineering team, co-authored the book, CEO of Verica. Often called the "father of chaos engineering"
- **Nora Jones** — Co-pioneered chaos engineering at Netflix, co-author, founded Jeli

## Shared Principles

1. **Embrace Failure**: Systems will fail; design for it
2. **Experiment in Production**: Real insights require real conditions
3. **Automate Everything**: Including failure injection
4. **Build Confidence**: Through evidence, not hope
5. **Freedom & Responsibility**: Trust engineers to make decisions

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Chaos Engineering** for resilience testing philosophy
