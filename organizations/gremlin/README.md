# Gremlin Engineering

> "Break things on purpose to make them stronger."

## Engineering Philosophy

Gremlin commercialized and standardized chaos engineering, making it accessible to enterprises. Founded by Kolton Andrus (former Amazon/Netflix), they provide "Failure as a Service" and have codified best practices for safe, effective chaos experiments.

## Techniques

### Resilience & Reliability

- **[Enterprise Chaos Engineering](enterprise-chaos/)** — Structured failure injection, attack categories, safety controls
  - *Tutorials*: Gremlin Chaos Engineering Guide
  - *Impact*: Brought chaos engineering to enterprises like Walmart, Twilio, Expedia

## Key Figures

- **Kolton Andrus** — Co-founder & CEO, former Amazon/Netflix reliability engineer. Built chaos tools at both companies before founding Gremlin.

## Shared Principles

1. **Safety First**: Built-in safeguards and halt conditions
2. **Categorized Attacks**: Resource, network, state failures
3. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic attacks, graduate to complex
4. **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing experiments, not one-time tests
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Audit trails, RBAC, compliance

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Enterprise Chaos** for structured, safe failure injection
