# Functional Programming Masters

> "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." — Edsger Dijkstra

## The Pantheon

### Type Theory & Foundations

- **[Philip Wadler](wadler/)** — Monads, "Propositions as Types", Haskell design
  - *Focus*: Type theory, monadic composition, theoretical elegance

- **[Simon Peyton Jones](peyton-jones/)** — GHC architect, lazy evaluation master
  - *Focus*: Compiler design, laziness, practical functional programming

### Practical Simplicity

- **[Rich Hickey](hickey/)** — Creator of Clojure, "Simple Made Easy"
  - *Focus*: Simplicity, immutability, state management, pragmatic FP

## Shared Principles

These masters agree on:

1. **Immutability**: Data doesn't change; you create new data
2. **Pure Functions**: Same input, same output, no side effects
3. **Composition**: Build complex from simple through function composition
4. **Types as Documentation**: Types communicate intent and catch errors
5. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Say what, not how

## Core Concepts

```
Referential Transparency → Functions can be replaced by their values
Higher-Order Functions  → Functions that take/return functions
Algebraic Data Types    → Sum types + product types
Pattern Matching        → Destructure data elegantly
Lazy Evaluation         → Compute only what's needed
Monads                  → Composable computation patterns
```

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Hickey** for practical simplicity and real-world FP
2. **Add Wadler** for deep understanding of monads and types
3. **Layer Peyton Jones** for implementation insights and laziness
