# Systems Programming Masters

> "Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity." — Dennis Ritchie

## The Pantheon

### The Founders

- **[Ken Thompson](thompson/)** — Co-creator of Unix, C, Go, UTF-8, Plan 9
  - *Focus*: Elegant simplicity, small tools, regular expressions

- **[Dennis Ritchie](ritchie/)** — Co-creator of Unix, creator of C
  - *Focus*: Systems programming, language design, abstraction

### The Practitioner

- **[Linus Torvalds](torvalds/)** — Creator of Linux kernel and Git
  - *Focus*: Pragmatic excellence, performance, code review, subsystem design

### The Compiler Wizards

- **[Chris Lattner](lattner/)** — Creator of LLVM, Clang, Swift, MLIR
  - *Focus*: Compiler infrastructure, progressive lowering, library-first design

- **[Anders Hejlsberg](hejlsberg/)** — Creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#, TypeScript
  - *Focus*: Language design, type systems, IDE-driven development

- **[Fabrice Bellard](bellard/)** — Creator of QEMU, FFmpeg, TinyCC, JSLinux
  - *Focus*: Radical minimalism, solo mastery, making impossible things simple

- **[Mike Pall](pall/)** — Creator of LuaJIT
  - *Focus*: Trace-based JIT compilation, microarchitecture awareness

- **[Casey Muratori](muratori/)** — Creator of Handmade Hero
  - *Focus*: Performance-aware programming, data-oriented design, understanding hardware

- **[Jonathan Blow](blow/)** — Creator of Braid, The Witness, Jai language
  - *Focus*: Compile-time execution, programmer productivity, rejecting complexity

- **[Cliff Click](click/)** — Architect of HotSpot C2 compiler
  - *Focus*: Sea-of-nodes IR, speculative optimization, escape analysis

## Shared Principles

These masters agree on:

1. **Simplicity**: Do one thing well
2. **Composition**: Small tools combined with pipes
3. **Text Streams**: Universal interface
4. **Portability**: Write for the abstract machine
5. **Performance**: Understand the hardware

## The Unix Philosophy

```
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
```

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Thompson** for elegance and tool design philosophy
2. **Add Ritchie** for C idioms and systems abstractions
3. **Layer Torvalds** for kernel-level thinking and practical performance
