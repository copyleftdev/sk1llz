# Systems Programming Masters

> "Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity." — Dennis Ritchie

## The Pantheon

### The Founders

- **[Ken Thompson](thompson/)** — Co-creator of Unix, C, Go, UTF-8, Plan 9
  - *Focus*: Elegant simplicity, small tools, regular expressions

- **[Dennis Ritchie](ritchie/)** — Co-creator of Unix, creator of C
  - *Focus*: Systems programming, language design, abstraction

### The Practitioner

- **[Linus Torvalds](torvalds/)** — Creator of Linux kernel and Git
  - *Focus*: Pragmatic excellence, performance, code review, subsystem design

## Shared Principles

These masters agree on:

1. **Simplicity**: Do one thing well
2. **Composition**: Small tools combined with pipes
3. **Text Streams**: Universal interface
4. **Portability**: Write for the abstract machine
5. **Performance**: Understand the hardware

## The Unix Philosophy

```
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
```

## How to Use These Skills

1. **Start with Thompson** for elegance and tool design philosophy
2. **Add Ritchie** for C idioms and systems abstractions
3. **Layer Torvalds** for kernel-level thinking and practical performance
